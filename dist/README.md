# Siren Panel

Siren allows you to play a notification sound when an alert event arrive in your dashboard.

## Caveats

Google Chrome may block you by playing sounds before you interact with the page. You can disable this option going to [chrome://flags/#autoplay-policy](chrome://flags/#autoplay-policy) and selecting "No user gesture is required" for the option **Autoplay policy**.
